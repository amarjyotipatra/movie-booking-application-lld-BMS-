## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Entity Naming in JPQL Queries
- When using `@Entity(name = "customName")`, make sure to use the custom name in JPQL queries.
- Example: For `Show` entity with `@Entity(name = "shows")`, use `SELECT s FROM shows s` in JPQL.

#### Validation Annotations
- Use `@NotNull` instead of `@Nonnull` when you need to specify a message attribute.
- Example: `@NotNull(message = "User ID cannot be null")`

#### ShowSeatStatus Attribute
- The attribute name should follow camelCase convention: `showSeatStatus` not `ShowSeatStatus`.

#### PaymentStatus Enum
- Avoid duplicate values in the enum (e.g., SUCCESS and SUCCESSFUL).
